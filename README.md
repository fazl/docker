# docker
learning how to use docker.. encapsulating development dependencies into a portable package sounds great
for one thing you can treat the docker file like a recipe for installing all the bits needed in your development environment
and you can fire it off on any machine with a build command
theoretically you can kiss goodbye to your "one special developement machine" risk

NOTE TO SELF: Remember to start each new tutorial/project inside this repo on a separate branch!
